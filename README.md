Week 5 homework task: Multiple choice quiz app

Welcome to my homework task of week 5. This homework task focuses on creating a 'Quiz app' which allows the user to answer some questions and displays their results at the end before restarting the quiz.

I have adjusted some styling components to make the application easy to read.
